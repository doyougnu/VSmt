** Performance

*** Store Ref (SRef SVal) in the state maps instead of the SBV a
    the idea here is to avoid lots of pack and unpacking of these values. The
    average case has is way more lookups then generations, so when we lookup we
    don't want any extra actions

*** Remove CV's from result maps and just construct the string to represent smtlib program

*** TODO Constant Folding

*** TODO Copy Propagation
    If we find a statement like:
    #+begin_example
    (assert (== x 2))
    #+end_example
    then do we perform propagation for x -> 2?

   - Note taken on [2020-09-14 Mon 18:36] \\
     Solver core is working for up to two choices now. However, the result module is not accumulating results properly. There are several problems:
       1. mappend is erasing previous results
       2. We fundamentally need a way to demarcate between variables which are local to the assertion stack and those which are not
       3. the ~ite~ building is not occurring the linked list of return values

*** Investigate possible uses of StableName

*** Investigate possible uses with IORef patterns
