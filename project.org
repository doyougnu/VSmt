* Project setup
** DONE Redirect dante to the nix directory
   CLOSED: [2020-08-31 Mon 11:28]
    I had setup .dir-locals.el to do this but dante still died for some reason

* Variational Solver

** Performance

*** Store Ref (SRef SVal) in the state maps instead of the SBV a
    the idea here is to avoid lots of pack and unpacking of these values. The
    average case has is way more lookups then generations, so when we lookup we
    don't want any extra actions

** Optimizations

*** TODO Constant Folding

*** TODO Copy Propagation
    If we find a statement like:
    #+begin_example
    (assert (== x 2))
    #+end_example
    then do we perform propagation for x -> 2?
