* Project setup
** TODO Redirect dante to the nix directory
    I had setup .dir-locals.el to do this but dante still died for some reason

* Variational Models
** Goals
   Given a v-model you can:
     1. solve for all configurations a specific variable as a specific value or a range of values
     2. Given a configuration, solve for the value of a or all variables
     3. Figure out which variants were sat
** This works, satisfies the goals, and is compatible with the most solvers
   #+begin_src
   (declare-const p Bool)
   (declare-const q Bool)
   (declare-const r Int)
   (assert (=> (and p q) (= r 1)))
   (assert (=> (and p (not q)) (= r 12)))
   (assert (=> (and (not p) q) (= r 123)))
   (assert (=> (and (not p) (not q)) (= r 1234)))
   ;; these cannot be used together
   (assert (= r 12)) ;; return models were the variable as a specific value
   (assert (and p q)) ;; what is the value of r when p and q are true?
   (check-sat)
   (get-model)
   #+end_src
   Except that it is too permissive ~ite~ works though
